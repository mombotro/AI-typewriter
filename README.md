# AI Typewriter - Local Deployment, Single-Click Startup, and Usage Guide

This guide explains how to deploy this AI-powered text editor (built with Next.js) on your own computer. It also details how to set up a single-click startup method and provides a comprehensive usage guide.

## About the Application

This application is an AI-powered text editor that leverages various "flows" to help you create and edit text. These flows are designed to enhance your writing process by offering contextual suggestions, plotline outlining, targeted revisions, and text continuation.

## Local Deployment

Follow these steps to set up the application on your local machine:

1.  **Install Node.js:**
    -   If you don't have Node.js installed, download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions. Node.js usually comes with npm (Node Package Manager).

2.  **Navigate to the Project:**
    -   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this Next.js project using the `cd` command.

3. **Install dependencies:**
    -   Run `npm install` to download all project dependencies.

4. **Start the Development Server:**
    - Run `npm run dev` to start the application.
    - The app will be running on a local address, usually http://localhost:3000.

## Single-Click Startup

For a more convenient way to start the application without typing commands in the terminal, you can create a shortcut or an executable script.

1.  **Create `run_app.sh`:**
    -   A `run_app.sh` file has been created in the root directory. This file contains the command `npm run dev`. (On windows, create a `run_app.bat` with the content `npm run dev`)

2. **Make Shortcut:**
    - Navigate to the `run_app.sh` file.
    - Create a shortcut on your desktop to this file.
    - Double clicking this shortcut should now run the Next.js app.

## Usage Guide

This AI Typewriter application is designed to enhance your writing through several AI-powered "flows." These flows provide various functionalities to assist you in different stages of the writing process.

### Available Flows

1.  **Contextual Suggestions**
    -   **Description:** This flow analyzes the context of your writing and provides relevant suggestions to help you refine your sentences and paragraphs.
    -   **How to Use:** As you type, the AI will offer real-time suggestions that you can choose to incorporate into your text. These suggestions can help improve clarity, coherence, and style.

2.  **Targeted Revisions**
    -   **Description:** This flow allows you to specify parts of your text that need improvement. The AI then focuses on those areas to provide targeted revisions.
    -   **How to Use:** Select a section of your text and specify what you want to improve (e.g., grammar, clarity, tone). The AI will offer revisions tailored to your specific needs.

3.  **Text Continuation**
    -   **Description:** This flow can continue your text by predicting what might come next, helping you overcome writer's block and maintain a consistent flow.
    -   **How to Use:** Write a few sentences, and then use the text continuation flow to get suggestions for what to write next. You can then select or edit the AI's suggestions to match your creative vision.

### Using the Flows
